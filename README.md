## Synopsis

I used the GIPHY API to make a dyname webpage that populate anime related gifs based on pre-chosen and user choices.

#What files I have 
This project contains only the following files: index.html and app.js

## Motivation

This project was the 7th homework assignment for me by the Northwestern University Bootcamp. The goal was to call an API and use Javascript/Jquery to change the HTML of my site.

## API Reference

**GIPHY API**
I am using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy). I signed up on their site and have my own key to access their API data. To learn more about this, please visit: [GIPHY Devs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).
